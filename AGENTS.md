## Code rules
- if it is boolean variable, use `is` prefix
- use styledComponents for styling and put it in the bottom of file where it located
- use export default for components if its possible
- follow semantic versioning for releases
- keep commits small and focused
- write clear, concise commit messages
- review code changes before committing
- document new features and API changes
- maintain consistent code style and formatting
- use meaningful variable and function names
- avoid magic numbers and strings where possible
- keep documentation up to date with code changes
- consider performance implications of new code
- handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
- use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- comment complex logic to improve readability
- use small components and functions, avoid big monoliths
- prefer functional programming patterns where appropriate
- minimize global state and side effects
- use TypeScript for better type safety
- follow consistent indentation and formatting rules
- use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes)
- organize code into logical modules and directories
- avoid deeply nested structures and long functions
- prefer early returns and guard clauses to reduce nesting
- use immutable data structures where appropriate
- favor pure functions over impure ones when possible
- use consistent error handling patterns throughout the codebase
- validate input parameters at function boundaries
- if u change sql, add migrations in different file separatly, plus make one big if I need to start from begininng
- write very secure code - it should pass security checks
