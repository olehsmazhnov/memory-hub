You are a senior full-stack engineer. Build the WEB part of an MVP first.
Took design from Telegram App

Goal:
Create a minimal “text archive” web app where a user can:
1) Sign up / log in
2) Create folders
3) Add text notes inside a folder
That’s it. Text only for now (no links, no images, no share extension).

Tech requirements:
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Supabase (Auth + Postgres)
- Keep architecture simple and production-clean
- No over-engineering

Functional requirements:
- Auth:
  - Email/password sign up
  - Email/password sign in
  - Sign out
- Folders:
  - Create folder (title required)
  - List user folders (newest first)
  - Select active folder
- Notes (text only):
  - Create note in selected folder (non-empty content)
  - List notes for selected folder (chronological)
- Data isolation:
  - Users must only access their own folders/notes (RLS)

Database schema:
- folders: id (uuid pk), user_id (uuid fk auth.users), title (text), created_at (timestamptz)
- notes: id (uuid pk), folder_id (uuid fk folders), user_id (uuid fk auth.users), content (text), created_at (timestamptz)

Security:
- Enable RLS on both tables
- Add policies for select/insert/update/delete restricted to auth.uid() = user_id
- For note insert, ensure folder belongs to same user

Project output required:
1) Setup commands
2) Full SQL migration (tables, indexes, RLS policies)
3) Next.js code scaffold with:
   - Supabase client
   - Single MVP page (or small component split) for auth + folders + notes
4) `.env.local.example`
5) Run instructions
6) Quick test checklist

UI requirements:
- Very simple 2-column layout:
  - Left: folders + create folder input
  - Right: notes list + add note input
- Basic empty states and error messages

Non-goals:
- No mobile app
- No links/photos/files
- No realtime subscriptions yet
- No i18n and no advanced styling

Execution style:
- Implement in small verifiable steps.
- After each step, show:
  - files created/changed
  - exact code
  - how to verify it works
- If something fails, pick the most stable fix and continue until app runs locally.
